                <h2><em>What I do?</em></h2>
                <p>
                  I am a highly opinionated developer. Making the code work is not enough, it should be elegant, it should be reusable, quickly deployable, and readable.

                <p>
                  I prefer to develop anything Web: websites, CMS, web app, software to web integration.
